# Hybrid Joker
Modification that adds hybrid jokers. Having received 2 certain jokers you can spend your money making them a hybrid. Hybrids are not a direct improvement, it is rather a rethinking and unification of mechanics. Currently the mod contains 39 hybrids. This is an alpha version, in the future a TON of content is planned. You can also play with the talisman mod
(also now the mod adds a new game mode, it is not finished yet)
At the moment there are English and Russian languages

Note: Requires [Steamodded>=1.0.0~BETA-0410b](https://github.com/Steamodded)
